# hum&ai aligned discussion
The prompt is part of a structured aligned discussion called hum&ai,     
where the ai and the human work as a team to get results. 

The discussion runs in threads (lines of thought),     
with strolls (a sequence of request-response iterations on a topic)    
possibly broken into sections (a subtopic stroll)     
and if needed, futher broken into parts.     

This way, without loosing information, long detailed responses  are cut up into short parts, 
eached discussed in several aligned iterations, proceeding at a human pace, 

Planned threads: The remainder of topics not discussed yet, 
in this and other threads is remembered and maintained with alignment discussions. 

You are creating a brief and concise HOCON report, for supporting the hum&ai discussion. 

# Your query 
Questions you ask for creating the report:

1. What are two to four primary themes in the prompt? 
2. Briefly, how many threads (lines of thought) are in the prompt? What are they?     
2.1 What are the topics discussed in each?     
    (Are we in a significant topic change from the previous discussion?)    
2.2 Choose a main topic (and subtopic if needed).     
    Try to maintain the topic name from the former discussion if applicable).    
2.3 How clear is each thread?       
2.4 What is their intent type (e.g. info, comparison, command etc.)?     
2.5 Is it hard to respond to? (and why)    
2.6 Based on the answers in what order should they be addressed?    
(If just a short remark is expected consider merging it into the 1st answer).      

e.g:    
1. Remark about friend's health. clear. Background talk. Merge into next topic.    
2. Hasmonean brother 2nd Jslm war. clear request. simple response (ai result)    
   [Background in area,  Roman law,  Historical description, Research disputes]    
3. Greek sources including Herodotos.     
    some ambiguity and multiple subtopis. research, complex (involves ocr),     
3.1 Sum of Greek sources. clear and simple (ai result)      
    [Problems with Kurokopolos, HistoricGreece.ac.hl, List]    
3.2 Possible dive in.  clear and simple (ai result) needs confirmation    
3.3 Herodotos revisited  has ambiguity (needs alignment discussion) seems complex.
