# BinAI.ai
The AI reformer. Knows what it doesn't. Teams with you to get it right.

## About This Project

BinAI.ai is built on a philosophy of transparency and collaboration in AI interactions. We believe in:
- **Knowing what we don't know**: Acknowledging limitations honestly
- **Teaming with you**: Working collaboratively to achieve the right outcome
- **Continuous improvement**: Learning and reforming how AI systems work

## Quick Start

### Lost Conversation Context?
If you're wondering "what happened to our last conversation?", see our guide on [Conversation Continuity](CONVERSATION_CONTINUITY.md).

**TL;DR**: AI conversations are session-based. To continue a previous discussion, simply provide a brief summary of what you were working on, and we'll rebuild the context together!
